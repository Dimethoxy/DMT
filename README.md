# Dimethoxy Library (WIP)

The Dimethoxy Library is the core engine behind all Dimethoxy plugins — a modular C++ codebase built for high-performance digital signal processing and plugin development.
From custom DSP algorithms to GUI systems and utility wrappers, this library powers nearly every aspect of our audio tools.

> [!WARNING]
> This library is under active development and primarily intended for use within Dimethoxy projects. 
> External use is unsupported.

## Features
- 🚀 High-performance DSP tailored for aggressive electronic music (Hardstyle, Hardcore, Uptempo, etc.)
- 🎛️ Modular components for efficient plugin development
- 🧱 Shared utilities, math, parameter handling, and UI helpers
- 🧪 Designed for maintainability and extensibility across multiple projects
